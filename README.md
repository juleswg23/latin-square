### Intro

[KenKen](https://www.kenkenpuzzle.com/) is a logic puzzle game required solvers to fill a [Latin Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square) with values corresponding to mathematical clues in different regions. More famously, Sudoku is also a Latin Square grid.

This is a work in progress, as the generator is not fully functional yet.
